# MANDATORY PART

 ## Program name: :green_circle: push_swap

 Passed moulinette? :yellow_circle: - not yet

 Turn in files: Makefile, *.h, *.c

 External functs. read, write, malloc, free, exit. ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded

 Libft authorized: yes

Description: Sort stacks

*Note:* I've found that radix sort does not work for this project. It was one of my first attempts, but it doesn't handle negative numbers well and although it's possible to pass push_swap with it, it's not the most optimal algorithm due to our limitation of movements.
