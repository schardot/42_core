# Minitalk ðŸ“¡ðŸ’¬

Minitalk is a project that demonstrates inter-process communication (IPC) using Unix signals. It allows clients to send messages to a server, which receives and processes them in real-time. The project also supports Unicode characters, enabling the transmission of a broader range of messages.

## Features

- **Signal-based Communication**: Uses Unix signals to transmit messages between a client and a server.
- **Server and Client**: The server listens for incoming messages, while the client sends messages using signals.
- **Dynamic Message Handling**: Supports sending messages of variable length, including Unicode characters.
