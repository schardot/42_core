Theory on Born2Beroot

Project overview
The student being evaluated should explain to you simply:
How a virtual machine works.
Their choice of operating system.
The basic differences between Rocky and Debian.
The purpose of virtual machines.
If the evaluated student chose Rocky: what SELinux and DNF are.
If the evaluated student chose Debian: the difference between aptitude and apt, and what APPArmor
is. During the defense, a script must display information all every 10 minutes. Its operation will be
checked in detail later. If the explanations are not clear, the evaluation stops here.
