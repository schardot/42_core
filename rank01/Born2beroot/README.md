# Born2beroot 🛡️

Born2beroot is a system administration project that focuses on setting up a secure server. The main objective is to create a virtual machine with strong security measures and learn about Linux system administration, user management, and networking.

## 🔧 Project Overview

- Configure a virtual machine using **Debian** or **CentOS**.
- Set up user and group management.
- Implement strong password policies and SSH configuration.
- Ensure the system adheres to specific security standards (firewall, UFW).
- Configure a monitoring system for the server's activity.

## 🛠️ Steps

- **Install and configure the VM:** Use VirtualBox or another VM software to set up a minimal Debian or CentOS environment.
- **User management:** Create and manage users, groups, and passwords following best security practices.
- **SSH and firewall setup:** Configure SSH for secure access and set up a firewall (UFW or iptables) to control traffic.
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring scripts or use tools like cron and rsyslog to check system activity.

## 📄 Security Practices
- Enforce password strength and expiration policies.
- Disable root SSH login and set up public key authentication.
- Install and configure a firewall to manage network traffic.
- Ensure services and software are regularly updated.
