# 42 Core Curriculum ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of my assignments and coursework from my studies at 42, starting in April 2024 and ongoing. These projects emphasize low-level programming, algorithms, and problem-solving using C and shell scripting.

Here is a list of some of the projects included in this repository:

**Rank 00 - [Libft](./rank00/libft)**
   - Libft is a custom C library that reimplements essential standard C functions, focusing on string manipulation, memory management, and linked lists. It serves as a foundation for many future projects in the 42 curriculum.
   - **Tech stack:** C, Memory management, Data structures
